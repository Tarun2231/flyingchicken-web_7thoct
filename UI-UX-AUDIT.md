# 🎨 UI/UX Audit Report - Flying Chicken

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Color Contrast Issues** ⚠️ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Yellow badges (`bg-secondary`) with white text had poor readability

- WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Yellow (#FFD700) on white text = ~1.5:1 (FAIL)

**Fixed:**

- ✅ Home page: Changed Mid plan badge from `bg-secondary` to `bg-purple-400`
- ✅ Vendors page: Changed Mid plan badge from `bg-secondary` to `bg-purple-400`
- ✅ Now using purple-400 (#A78BFA) which has better contrast with white text

---

### 2. **Button Hover State Issue** ⚠️ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Secondary hero button had `hover:text-secondary` (yellow text on white)

- Yellow text on white background = invisible/unreadable

**Fixed:**

- ✅ Changed to `hover:text-primary` (purple text on white)
- ✅ Purple (#7A1E74) on white = 8.8:1 contrast (EXCELLENT)

---

### 3. **Plan Card Gradient Colors** ⚠️ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Gradient colors didn't match new purple/yellow theme

- Premium: `from-primary to-orange-600` (purple to orange - odd)
- Mid: `from-secondary to-purple-600` (yellow to purple - okay but suboptimal)

**Fixed:**

- ✅ Premium: Changed to `from-primary to-secondary` (purple to yellow - brand colors)
- ✅ Mid: Changed to `from-purple-400 to-purple-600` (consistent purple gradient)
- ✅ Free: Kept `from-gray-400 to-gray-600` (neutral)
